	<p>“I dearly love a laugh.”</br>Comics and graphic novels are the perfect antidote. They’re short, have pictures, and can be really funny.</p>

		<h2> I HATE FAIRYLAND</h2>
		<p>BY SKOTTIE YOUNG AND JEAN- FRANCOIS BEAULIEU</p>
		<p> Gertrude, or Gert, gets sucked through a hole in her bedroom floor that transports her into Fairyland. Think: Alice falling into Wonderland, only this Alice has a really bad attitude and a penchant for murder. Gert gets dumped into Fairyland against her will, and then gets stuck there for 40 years. Despite the years that pass, Gert stays in the same child body, and never grows to like Fairyland. Actually, Gert HATES Fairyland. Like, she carries around a battle axe and murders anything that gets in her way. Oh, and she has a dirty mouth, but instead of the actual profanities, Fairyland morphs her curses to words like “fluff” and “gob-ding’d.” It’s so hilarious.</p>

		<h2> THE PRINCE AND THE DRESSMAKER</h2>
		<p>BY JEN WANG</p>
		<p> Prince Sebastian has a secret. He’s been moonlighting as Lady Crystallia by night, while his family works to find him a bride by day. Frances is Sebastian’s dressmaker, and although Lady Crystallia’s clothes are taking Paris by storm, Frances has to stay in the shadows so she doesn’t give away Sebastian’s secret. This all sounds kind of serious, but I assure you: this is one the cutest, most delightful books I’ve ever read. And it’s really funny. </p>

It’s super cute.</p>

		<h2>The Big Sick (2017)</h2>
		
		<p> Emily Gordon and Kumail Nanjiani nabbed a Best Original Screenplay nomination for synthesizing their harrowing true romance into a sharp and winsome comedy about a courtship that begins with a culture clash and survives a coma. After Gordon and Nanjiani wrote the script as an intense form of couples therapy, uber-producer Judd Apatow and director Michael Showalter whipped it into shape and cast Zoe Kazan as the young woman who falls for a Pakistani-American comic and Uber driver (Nanjiani). When she’s hospitalized, her parents (Holly Hunter and Ray Romano) learn to appreciate her tortured lover’s affection for their sleeping beauty before she comes back to life.</p>
